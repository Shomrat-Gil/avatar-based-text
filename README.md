## Create dynamic name avatar/icon like Google.

Note: You will need place the font file `arial.ttf` in an accessible directory for this to work. 

Suggestion - Instead of generating an image you can use this alternative In your frontend:

    <object type="image/jpeg" data="https://user.jpeg">
      <div>
        Some Text
      </div>
    </object>
